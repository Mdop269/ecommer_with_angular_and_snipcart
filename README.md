# EcommerceWebsiteWithApi

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Tasks:

ref : 
    https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-searchbar?file=app%2Fapp.component.ts
    (this is better for search )

    https://primeng.org/carousel
    (it is way better for using slide and all )

There could be several reasons why this class is not working as expected in your code. Here are some potential issues to check:
1. Missing PrimeNG Module Imports
If you are using PrimeNG for the p-carousel component, you need to make sure that the necessary modules are imported in your Angular application. Specifically:
CarouselModule: This is the module that provides the p-carousel component.
TagModule: This is required for the p-tag component.
Ensure that you have these modules imported in your Angular module (e.g., app.module.ts):
import { CarouselModule } from 'primeng/carousel';
import { TagModule } from 'primeng/tag';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports
    CarouselModule,
    TagModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}

2. CSS Styling
Ensure that your CSS styles are correctly defined. Sometimes, CSS rules may not work as expected due to specificity issues or missing styles.
The m-2, p-3, surface-border, border-round, and other classes might come from a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or PrimeNG. Ensure that you have the necessary stylesheets or frameworks included in your project.
If you're using PrimeNG, ensure that you've also imported the correct theme CSS file in your angular.json or index.html:
"styles": [
  "node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/lara-light-indigo/theme.css",
  "node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css"
]

3. Responsive Options Not Defined
The [responsiveOptions] input property in your <p-carousel> is used to set how many items are visible based on the screen size. Ensure that responsiveOptions is defined in your component. If it is undefined, it may cause issues with the carousel display:
responsiveOptions = [
  {
    breakpoint: '1024px',
    numVisible: 3,
    numScroll: 1
  },
  {
    breakpoint: '768px',
    numVisible: 2,
    numScroll: 1
  },
  {
    breakpoint: '560px',
    numVisible: 1,
    numScroll: 1
  }
];

4. Dynamic Values
The [value]="products" binding implies that products is a variable in your component. Ensure that products is correctly initialized and contains the data you expect. If products is empty or not properly defined, the carousel will not render anything.
Example:
products = [
  { title: 'Product 1', price: 99.99, thumbnail: 'url1', availabilityStatus: 'In Stock' },
  { title: 'Product 2', price: 49.99, thumbnail: 'url2', availabilityStatus: 'Out of Stock' },
  // more products...
];

5. Check for Errors in the Console
Inspect the browser's developer tools (Console tab) for any errors. Missing dependencies, incorrect imports, or runtime errors in your component could cause the carousel or other elements to fail to render properly.
6. Ensure the Correct Angular Version
PrimeNG requires specific Angular versions to work correctly. Make sure the Angular version you are using is compatible with the version of PrimeNG you're trying to use. You can check the compatibility in the PrimeNG documentation.
7. Image Paths and Accessibility
Make sure the product.thumbnail value is valid and points to an existing image. If the image path is incorrect or the image doesn't exist, the carousel might not render the item correctly.
Double-check that the alt text is properly populated, as an empty value might cause rendering issues for some users or environments.
8. The getSeverity Method
The [severity]="getSeverity(product.availabilityStatus)" directive requires the getSeverity method to return an appropriate severity level. Ensure that this method is defined and works as expected:
getSeverity(status: string): string {
  switch (status) {
    case 'In Stock':
      return 'success';
    case 'Out of Stock':
      return 'danger';
    default:
      return 'info';
  }
}

9. p-carousel Configuration
Ensure that the p-carousel component is correctly configured, and test with basic configuration first (without too many customizations) to confirm that the carousel renders at all.
Conclusion
By ensuring that your module imports are correct, your CSS and styles are properly configured, and the necessary data is available in your component, you should be able to make the class work. Debugging with browser developer tools and checking for errors will also help identify specific issues.
